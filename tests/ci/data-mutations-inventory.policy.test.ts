// Regression guard for #198 — docs↔code drift in the mutation inventory.
//
// docs/reference/data-mutations.md carries a "current inventory" table naming
// every write hook and its optimistic/non-optimistic classification. That table
// drifted: it listed `useCreateInvitation`, `useRevokeInvitation`, and
// `useResendInvitation`, none of which exist — core-be models an invite as an
// `invited` membership, so the real hooks are `useInviteMember` (create) and
// `useRemoveMember` (revoke), and there is no resend hook. The weekly advisory
// `docs:staleness` canary caught it after the fact.
//
// This locks that specific doc so the same class can't silently reappear on a
// PR: every `use<X>` hook the inventory names must resolve to a real `src/`
// export. We run the actual staleness scanner (the source of truth) and scope
// the assertion to this one file — unrelated advisory drift elsewhere stays the
// weekly canary's job and must never make this deterministic test flaky.
