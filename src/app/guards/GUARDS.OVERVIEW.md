# `src/app/guards/` — Layered route access checks

Composable **`beforeLoad` functions** (never wrapper components — those render before
redirecting). Spec: `docs/reference/routing-and-tenancy.md` §5. Frontend guards are UX
only; the backend/RLS re-checks everything. UI-level checks use `PermissionGuard` /
`useRBAC` in `src/shared/`.

Platform overview: [`docs/reference/frontend-platform.md`](../../../docs/reference/frontend-platform.md).

## Guard chain for `/organization/$organizationSlug/*`

| #   | Guard                                           | Lives in                   | Failure                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `requireAuth`                                   | `core/rbac/guards.ts`      | redirect `/login`                                                                                                                                |
| 2   | `requireProvisionedWorkspace`                   | `route-guards.ts`          | not onboarded → `/onboarding`; personal active org → `/dashboard`; no team workspace → `/organization` picker                                    |
| 3   | `requireOrganizationContext($organizationSlug)` | `route-guards.ts`          | malformed param / unknown org / non-member → **404** (existence never leaked)                                                                    |
| 4   | `requireActiveOrganization`                     | `route-guards.ts`          | slug not synced for URL → **404** (fail closed); suspended → `…/suspended` (which itself skips this guard to avoid redirect loops)               |
| 5   | `gatewayFromManifest(manifest)`                 | `core/security/gateway.ts` | L1 session + L5 `manifest.permission` + L6b `manifest.module` → `/unauthorized` or `notFound` per `onDeny`                                       |
| 6   | Resource scope                                  | route **loader** fetch     | NOT a guard: the API returns the resource scoped to the organization; 404/403 map to the NotFound/Unauthorized islands. One fetch, no waterfall. |

`requireFeature(moduleKey)` in `core/security/gates/require-module.ts` is a synchronous
helper for ad-hoc loaders; routes with a manifest should use step 5 instead.

Dashboard (`…/dashboard`) runs `gatewayFromManifest(dashboardManifest)` then
`requireOrgStatus` in `routeTree.tsx`.

## Guard chain for `/dashboard` (personal)

| #   | Guard                                    | Lives in                   | Failure                                                                                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `requireAuth`                            | `core/rbac/guards.ts`      | redirect `/login`                                                                             |
| 2   | `requirePersonalDeployment`              | `route-guards.ts`          | team-only deployment → `/`                                                                    |
| 3   | `requireProvisionedPersonalDashboard`    | `route-guards.ts`          | not onboarded → `/onboarding`; team active org → that slug's dashboard (same as `/` resolver) |
| 4   | `gatewayFromManifest(dashboardManifest)` | `core/security/gateway.ts` | permission + module gates (same manifest as team dashboard)                                   |

Both workspace guards delegate to `resolveRootTarget` in `shared/tenancy/organization-resolver.ts` — one rule for all deployments, which gates onboarding on `user.onboarding_completed` before any active-org routing. Session reads use the cache-first `ensureSessionContext` in `shared/tenancy/session-context.ts`.

## Guard chain for `/onboarding`

| #   | Guard                        | Lives in              | Failure                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `requireAuth`                | `core/rbac/guards.ts` | redirect `/login`                                                                                                    |
| 2   | `requireOnboardingWorkspace` | `route-guards.ts`     | already onboarded (`onboarding_completed`) → `/dashboard` or team slug dashboard (same as `/` resolver; no re-entry) |

`requireOrganizationContext` also **syncs the derived `useOrganizationStore` from the URL**
(the param is canonical — routing-and-tenancy.md §4) and refetches per-organization
permissions when the organization changes (`shared/tenancy/organization-membership.ts`).

## Sanctioned exceptions

- **Bespoke-guard routes (no `gatewayFromManifest`):** `/onboarding` (`requireAuth` +
  `requireOnboardingWorkspace`) and the `/organization` picker (`requireAuth` +
  `requireProvisionedWorkspace`). Both manifests declare `permission: null` — their access
  rule is session + workspace state, not a permission, so the gateway would be a no-op.
- **Suspended leaf:** `…/suspended` runs `gatewayFromManifest(manifest)` but intentionally
  **skips `requireOrgStatus`** — the blocked state must render for a suspended organization
  without redirect-looping into itself.

| `route-guards.ts`         | Org + workspace guards composing `shared/tenancy` (`requireOrganizationContext`, `requireProvisioned*Dashboard`, …) |
| `org-gates.ts`            | Thin `Gate` wrappers for the org route space (used with `gateway()`)                                                |
| `RBACGuard.tsx` (+ .test) | In-page permission gating component (rendering-level, not route-level)                                              |

Auth + permission primitives stay in `core/rbac/guards.ts` (`requireAuth`,
`requirePermission`); the **security gateway** (`gatewayFromManifest`, `gatewayFromPolicy`)
lives in `core/security/gateway.ts`. Route registration applies the chain in
`src/app/routes/routeTree.tsx` `beforeLoad` hooks.
