# `src/shared/tenancy/` — Organization context, membership, resolution

First-class tenancy area (spec: `docs/reference/routing-and-tenancy.md` §6). Lives in
`shared/` — NOT `core/` — because it composes the Zustand store, organization APIs, and
storage; the core kernel stays app-state-free (same reasoning as `shared/auth/`).
"Tenancy" is the sanctioned infra-layer term; everything user-facing says **organization**.

**Companion tiers** (see [`docs/reference/documentation-tiers.md`](../../../docs/reference/documentation-tiers.md)):
[PATTERNS](./TENANCY.PATTERNS.md) — the idioms · [FLOWS](./TENANCY.FLOWS.md) — the
runtime sequences · [POLICIES](./TENANCY.POLICIES.md) — the invariants.

**The URL is the single source of truth for organization context.** Inside
`/organization/$organizationSlug/*` the route param is canonical; `useOrganizationStore` is a
derived cache synced FROM the route. The `/` resolver's redirect choice comes from
me/context (the active organization); a subdomain, when present, only seeds a boot-time
store fallback. localStorage plays no role in organization context.

| `organization-context.ts`       | `syncOrganizationFromRoute` (URL → store), `getActiveOrganizationId`                                                                                             |
| `organization-membership.ts`    | `findMembership`, `ensurePermissionsFor` — refetches permissions when the organization changes (a once-if-empty check would leak org A's permissions into org B) |
| `organization-resolver.ts`      | `resolveRootRedirect` for `/`: **not onboarded** (`!user.onboarding_completed`) → onboarding; else active org (validated) → dashboard, else picker               |
| `my-organizations.ts` (+ .test) | `listMyOrganizations()`, `createOrganization()` + schemas                                                                                                        |
| `tenancy-service.ts` (+ .test)  | Subdomain fallback resolution (`resolveOrganizationFromSubdomain`) — boot-time default for the organization header                                               |

## Consumers

- `app/guards/route-guards.ts` — the `$organizationSlug` guard chain
- `app/routes/routeTree.tsx` — `/` resolver
- `core/rbac/guards.ts` — reads the derived store's permission set for `requirePermission`
- `OrganizationSwitcher`, `CreateOrganizationDialog`, onboarding — navigate to
  `/organization/$organizationSlug/dashboard` and let the guard sync everything
