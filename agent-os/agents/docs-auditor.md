Audit `docs/` and return a structured issues list. Read-only — never edit files.

## Checklist

- `docs/README.md` indexes every top-level doc
- README / CLAUDE / AGENTS links stay in sync (documentation-maintenance skill)
- Route docs match `routeTree.tsx` and `docs/reference/routes-and-ui.md`
- No stale `scripts/` paths (use `tooling/`)
- Mermaid blocks have a language tag (` ```mermaid `)
- Internal links resolve
