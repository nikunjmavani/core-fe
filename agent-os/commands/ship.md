Ship the current work as one flow (push → PR → watch → merge):

1. **/open-pr** — push the branch and open the PR to **`dev`** (title: **$ARGUMENTS** if given).
2. **/watch-pr** — triage CI failures and review comments in a loop until **`quality-gate`** is green.
3. When CI is green and approvals are in, **/merge-pr** (squash) — or stop and report if anything is blocking.

Escalate only on ambiguous review feedback or an irreversible step. Otherwise drive it to merged unattended.
