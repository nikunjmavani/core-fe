Watch PR **$ARGUMENTS** and keep it merge-ready:

1. Check PR status with `gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,mergeable,state` and subscribe to updates (re-check after pushes; do not poll with long `sleep` loops).
2. On a CI failure: inspect the failing lane in the **`quality-gate`** rollup (see `.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml`), diagnose root cause, push a fix to the branch, update the status checklist.
3. On a review comment: if the fix is unambiguous, apply + push; if not, ask the user.
4. On a merge conflict or new push: rebase or resolve against **`dev`**, then re-verify with `/validate` or `pnpm health`.

Keep going until the PR is MERGED or CLOSED, or the user says stop. Reply only when something needs the user; otherwise let the PR diff be the record.
