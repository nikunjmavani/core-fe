description: Push the current branch and open a pull request to dev
argument-hint: [optional PR title]
allowed-tools: Bash(git push*), Bash(git status), Bash(git diff*), Bash(git log*)
---

Open a PR for the current branch — this command is the explicit opt-in that satisfies the "never open a PR unless asked" rule:

1. Confirm the branch and changeset: `git status`, `git log --oneline origin/dev..HEAD`.
2. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>` (retry with backoff on transient network errors).
3. Open the PR to **`dev`** via `gh pr create`: a conventional title (or **$ARGUMENTS** if given) and a body summarizing what changed, why, and how it was verified (`/validate`, `pnpm health`, or specific test commands run).
4. Report the PR URL.

Do not force-push, and do not target any base branch other than **`dev`** without explicit confirmation.
