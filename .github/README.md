# GitHub automation (core-fe)

Long-lived branches: _dev_ (development), _main_ (production).

Workflow _file names_ describe _what_ runs; the YAML `name:` field is what appears in the GitHub Actions UI and in required status checks.

## Orchestrator workflows

| What it does                                 | File                                             | When it runs                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| PR merge gate (lint, typecheck, unit, build) | [pr-ci.yml](workflows/pr-ci.yml)                 | `pull_request` → `main`, `release/**` |
| PR title, labels, `.env` guard               | [pr-governance.yml](workflows/pr-governance.yml) | Every PR event                        |
| Post-merge pipeline                          | [post-merge-ci.yml](workflows/post-merge-ci.yml) | push to `main` / `release/**`         |
| Weekly Lighthouse budgets                    | [lighthouse.yml](workflows/lighthouse.yml)       | Wed 03:00 UTC                         |

Playwright E2E is local-only (`pnpm test:e2e` against a live core-be on `:3000`) — CI never boots the backend; deploys only need the backend URL (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

## Reusable workflows

| What it does                 | File                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vitest unit + patch coverage | [reusable-vitest-unit-only.yml](workflows/reusable-vitest-unit-only.yml) |
| Netlify deploy               | [reusable-netlify-deploy.yml](workflows/reusable-netlify-deploy.yml)     |

## Repo config

| Path                           | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [environments/](environments/) | GitHub Environment docs + drift checks         |
| [rulesets/](rulesets/)         | Branch protection as code (`pnpm github:sync`) |
| [workflows/](workflows/)       | CI/CD YAML                                     |
