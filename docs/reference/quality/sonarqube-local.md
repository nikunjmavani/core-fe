# SonarQube — local quality gate

SonarQube runs **locally** (Docker) and is enforced as a **pre-push gate**: when you push commits
that touch deployed-surface code (`src/` runtime), the hook scans the project and **blocks the
push if SonarQube reports any unresolved issue or hotspot**. Everything is local — there is no
hosted SonarQube and no CI dependency. Same setup as core-be (`../core-be`), ported for this repo.

## TL;DR

```bash
pnpm sonar:up      # start the local SonarQube server (detached; first boot ~2 min)
pnpm sonar:scan    # scan now + print the report; exits non-zero if anything is open
git push           # the pre-push hook runs the same gate automatically
pnpm quality       # full local quality story: pnpm health (all phases) + the Sonar gate
```

First run provisions an analysis token into `.env.local` (gitignored); after that a scan is
~60–90s. The pre-push gate auto-starts the server if it is down.

## Commands (`sonar:*` namespace)

| Command            | What it does                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm sonar:up`    | Start the local SonarQube server (`docker-compose.sonar.yml`).                                          |
| `pnpm sonar:scan`  | Run the quality gate now: ensure server up → scan → wait → report. Exit 1 if any issue/hotspot, else 0. |
| `pnpm sonar:down`  | Stop the server (keeps the analysis volume).                                                            |
| `pnpm sonar:reset` | Wipe the volume and start fresh (`down -v`). Use if auth/state gets stuck.                              |

The server UI is at <http://localhost:9000>. Admin credentials are generated on first run and
stored in `.env.local` as `SONAR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `SONAR_TOKEN`.

### Sharing port 9000 with core-be

Both repos use `localhost:9000`. If core-be's SonarQube is already running, the gate **reuses it**
(one server, two projects — `core-fe` appears next to `core-be` in the same UI). For the gate to
mint a `core-fe` token there, copy `SONAR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `core-be/.env.local` into this
repo's `.env.local`. The scanner container always targets the host port (`host.docker.internal:9000`),
so it reaches whichever server owns it.

## How the pre-push gate works

The `.husky/pre-push` hook runs the gate **only when the pushed commits include deployed-surface
code** — `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` excluding tests, fixtures, and `mock-*` modules. Pushes that touch
only tests, scripts, docs, or config skip the scan (Sonar excludes those anyway — see
[Scope](#what-sonarqube-analyzes)).

The gate ([`scripts/sonar/sonar-gate.mjs`](../../../scripts/sonar/sonar-gate.mjs), a plain-Node
port of core-be's `tooling/sonar/sonar-gate.ts`):

1. **Auto-starts** the SonarQube container if it is not already up, and waits for it to be ready.
2. **Provisions a token** on first run (changes the default `admin/admin` password to a generated
   one, mints a token, saves both to `.env.local`). Idempotent afterwards.
3. **Scans** via the `sonar-scanner-cli` container.
4. **Waits** for the server to finish processing the report.
5. **Reports** every unresolved issue + hotspot and **exits 1** (blocking the push) if there is at
   least one; exits 0 when clean.

### Escape hatches

```bash
SKIP_SONAR=1 git push    # skip only the Sonar gate (still runs biome/typecheck/build/tests)
git push --no-verify     # skip all pre-push hooks
```

## What SonarQube analyzes

Analysis is scoped to the **deployed-application surface** (`src/` runtime). Excluded from
analysis (see [`sonar-project.properties`](../../../sonar-project.properties)):

- **Tests** — `*.test.ts(x)`, `*.spec.ts(x)`, `__tests__/`, plus the root `tests/` tree
  (Playwright e2e, k6 load, vitest utils — dev tooling with trusted inputs).
- **Mocks & fixtures** — `src/**/mock-*.ts`, `src/**/*.fixtures.ts` (REPLACE_WITH_API dev-only
  code carrying demo credentials and `Math.random()` seed data by design; production builds
  reject mock mode).
- **Generated and build artifacts** — `dist/`, `coverage/`, `*.d.ts`.

Coverage comes from vitest's lcov output (`pnpm test:ci` → `coverage/lcov.info`).

So a clean gate means **zero issues in the code that ships to production**.

## Troubleshooting

- **"failed to start SonarQube (is Docker running?)"** — start Docker Desktop, then retry.
- **"admin password is unknown"** — the instance was provisioned outside this flow (e.g. it is
  core-be's server). Copy `SONAR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `core-be/.env.local`, or run
  `pnpm sonar:reset` to start fresh.
- **Port 9000 already in use when `sonar:up` fails** — core-be's server owns the port; that is
  fine, see [Sharing port 9000](#sharing-port-9000-with-core-be).
- **Server slow / stuck after an upgrade** — `pnpm sonar:reset`.
- **Need to bypass once** — `SKIP_SONAR=1 git push` (see above), then fix and re-push.
