# Test coverage (core-fe)

How coverage is measured, gated, and ratcheted in this repo. For the **full test
matrix** see [`docs/reference/testing.md`](../testing.md); for layout and naming
rules see [`tests/README.md`](../../../tests/README.md) and
[`agent-os/rules/testing-requirements.mdc`](../../../agent-os/rules/testing-requirements.mdc).

## Runners

| Tool       | Scope                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vitest     | Unit/component — colocated `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`           |
| Playwright | E2E — `tests/e2e/*.e2e.test.ts` (requires core-be on `:3000`) |
| Stryker    | Mutation testing (CI-only, scheduled)                         |

Vitest runs two projects: **`unit`** (colocated `src` suites) and **`security`**
(`tests/security` — token storage, redirect safety, header tripwires). Coverage is collected by the `unit` project; the Vite config's React
Compiler is deliberately **off** under coverage so it measures source branches,
not synthetic memo-cache checks.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm test              # vitest run (all projects)
pnpm test:unit         # unit project only
pnpm test:security     # security project only
pnpm test:coverage          # run with coverage report
pnpm coverage:patch    # changed-lines coverage gate (PR CI)
```

## Global thresholds (ratchet)

Defined in `vitest.config.ts`. Pinned ~1% **under** measured coverage so CI fails
on regression, never on ambition. **Raise as coverage rises; never lower.**

| Metric     | Threshold |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Branches   | 59%       |
| Functions  | 61%       |
| Lines      | 66%       |
| Statements | 66%       |

## Patch coverage

PR CI also enforces **patch coverage** — changed lines must be ≥ 90%
(`tooling/ci/check-patch-coverage.mjs`, run as `pnpm coverage:patch`). This keeps
new/edited code well-covered even while the global ratchet rises gradually. The
`json-summary` reporter feeds the CI job-summary coverage table.

## Strict colocation

`pnpm validate:structure` fails any unit folder, island top-level UI
(`<Page>Page.tsx`/`<Page>Layout.tsx`), or flat-group component that lacks a
colocated `*.test.*`. Exemptions: route/manifest/contracts/search/fixtures/
constants role files, barrels, and `OVERVIEW` docs.

## Test ID and theme validators

| Gate                                    | Command                    |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Page/form/shell `data-testid` contracts | `pnpm validate:testids`    |
| Theme preset axis compliance            | `pnpm validate:theme-axis` |

Both run in `pnpm health` and PR CI (`static-sync` job).

## E2E (Playwright)

Requires **core-be** on `:3000` — verified in `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` before any spec runs. Hybrid selectors: **`agent-os/skills/playwright-e2e/SKILL.md`**, helpers in
`tests/utils/e2e-hybrid.ts`. Inventory: `docs/reference/e2e-testids-inventory.md`.

## Accessibility in tests

Component tests include `vitest-axe` assertions (`toHaveNoViolations()`); E2E uses
`@axe-core/playwright`. See the [test-generation skill](../../../agent-os/skills/test-generation/SKILL.md).
