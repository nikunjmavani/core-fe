# Local production performance audit

How to measure **real** bundle size and Lighthouse scores — not dev-server numbers.

---

## Dev vs production build

| Mode           | Command                         | Use for                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev**        | `pnpm dev` (`:5173`)            | Feature work, HMR, E2E with mock API           |
| **Production** | `pnpm build` then serve `dist/` | Bundle size, Lighthouse, PWA precache, TBT/CLS |

**Never** run Lighthouse against `pnpm dev`. Vite dev mode ships unminified code,
extra HMR clients, and different chunking — scores are not representative.

---

## Recommended workflow (this repo)

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview --port 5173 --strictPort
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm size                    # gzip limits on dist/ (same as CI)
# Optional — matches .lighthouserc.cjs:
npx @lhci/cli autorun       # needs preview on :5173 (see config)
```

**`pnpm preview`** (`vite preview`) is the canonical local production server:

- Serves the **built** `dist/` with the same asset paths as Netlify
- Used by **Lighthouse CI** (`.lighthouserc.cjs` → `startServerCommand`)
- Default port is `4173`; CI pins `--port 5173` to match E2E proxy habits

### Alternative: `serve`

```bash
pnpm build
npx serve dist -s -l 5173
```

Static `serve` (or `npx http-server dist`) is **acceptable** for manual Lighthouse
runs — you are still serving minified production assets. Prefer **`pnpm preview`**
when comparing to CI or debugging Vite-specific deploy behavior (SPA fallback,
headers from `dist/_headers` may differ).

**Safari / WebKit:** the meta CSP in `index.html` intentionally omits
`upgrade-insecure-requests` (that directive lives in `dist/_headers` for HTTPS
deploys only). Without this split, Safari upgrades `http://localhost` assets to
HTTPS and the app stuck on the boot splash during local preview.

For HTTPS parity with Netlify (optional):

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview:https --port 4173 --strictPort
```

## What to measure

| Gate                | Command                                                 | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial JS budget   | `pnpm size`                                             | Critical path + route chunks (`tooling/ci/run-size-limit.mjs`) |
| Lighthouse perf     | `npx @lhci/cli autorun` or Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse | Production URL only                                            |
| PWA precache weight | Inspect `dist/sw.js` or build log                       | Trimmed in `vite.config.ts` / custom SW                        |
| Unit + security     | `pnpm test`                                             | Regression guard after perf refactors                          |

Typical auth-route targets (after Phase A–D optimizations): Lighthouse performance
**~85+** on `/login`, TBT **&lt; 200ms**, initial critical JS **~208 kB** gzip —

## Full health pass

After large perf changes (10+ files):

```bash
pnpm health
```
