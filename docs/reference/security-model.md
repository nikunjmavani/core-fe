# Frontend security model

What the frontend defends against, how, and which risks are **deliberately
accepted** (so they aren't re-litigated in every review). The backend re-checks
everything — frontend controls are defense-in-depth and UX, never the only gate.

## Threats covered

| Threat                           | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Third-party telemetry (token / PII containment)

Sentry and PostHog run in the same JS context as the in-memory token, so their
capture settings are part of the threat model — verified:

- **Sentry replay** — `maskAllText: true` + `blockAllMedia: true`; inputs are
  masked by default and **network request headers/bodies are not captured**
  (no `networkDetailAllowUrls`), so the `Authorization: Bearer` header never
  reaches Sentry. `beforeSend` filters `ui.input` breadcrumbs and — together
  with `beforeSendTransaction` — scrubs `token` and Stripe `*_client_secret`
  query params from event and breadcrumb URLs (`lib/telemetry-scrub.ts`); only
  `user.id` is identified.
  ([`app/observability/sentry.ts`](../../src/app/observability/sentry.ts))
- **PostHog** — **consent-gated**: it sets cookies and captures pageviews, so it
  does not initialize until the user accepts the cookie banner
  (`shared/components/ConsentBanner`, `shared/store/useConsentStore`; `main.tsx`
  reacts to the decision and `initPostHog` refuses without consent). Beyond that:
  `autocapture: false` and `disable_session_recording: true` keep passive
  DOM/network capture off in code; only explicitly-coded events are sent;
  `before_send` scrubs `token` and Stripe `*_client_secret` params from
  `$current_url`-style properties; and
  `posthog.reset()` runs when the session ends so successive users on a shared
  device never chain into one anonymous profile. Accepting the banner emits a
  single `analytics_consent_decision` event (`shared/analytics/capture-consent-decision.ts`);
  decline is stored locally only.
  ([`app/analytics/posthog.ts`](../../src/app/analytics/posthog.ts)) Error
  monitoring (Sentry) is **not** gated — no tracking cookies, masked replay,
  legitimate interest.
- **Service worker** — precaches only static build assets + fonts; **no runtime
  caching of `/api`** or auth responses, so a shared device cannot serve one
  user's data to another from the SW cache. ([`src/sw.ts`](../../src/sw.ts))

### Content-Security-Policy delivery

The CSP ships **two ways**, both built from one source
([`lib/csp-api-origin.ts` → `buildContentSecurityPolicy`](../../src/lib/csp-api-origin.ts)):

- **Header** (`dist/_headers`, generated at build by `plugins/csp-api-origin.ts`)
  — authoritative: applies before the document parses and carries reporting
  directives. The committed `public/_headers` holds a minimal
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` line that the build upgrades to the full policy with
  the per-environment API origin injected into `connect-src`.
- **Meta** (`index.html`) — a parse-time fallback for hosts that drop the header.

Set `VITE_CSP_REPORT_URI` (e.g. a Sentry CSP ingest URL) to turn on
`report-uri`/`report-to` + a `Reporting-Endpoints` header, so production CSP
violations — including blocked XSS attempts — are collected instead of silent.

**Trusted Types (staged rollout).** The build also emits a
`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header carrying
`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`
([`buildTrustedTypesReportOnlyPolicy`](../../src/lib/csp-api-origin.ts)). This is
a structural DOM-XSS defense — it flags any script sink (`innerHTML`, `eval`, …)
that receives a plain string instead of a Trusted Type — shipped **report-only**
because React 19 is Trusted-Types-aware but Sentry/PostHog may use sinks. Once
the violation stream (collected via `VITE_CSP_REPORT_URI`) is clean, promote
`require-trusted-types-for 'script'` into the enforcing policy. Report-only is
header-only — `http-equiv` can't carry it — so there is no meta fallback.

## Accepted risks (intentional — do not "fix" without re-reading this)

1. **`style-src 'unsafe-inline'`.** Required by Tailwind v4's generated styles
   and Radix's inline positioning. Severity is low: with `script-src 'self'`
   locked, this permits CSS injection (UI redress, attribute-selector
   exfiltration) but **not** script execution. Removing it needs per-render
   nonces and fights the component stack. Accepted; revisit only if the styling
   approach changes.
2. **OAuth `state`/PKCE is not validated in the frontend.** By design the
   **backend is the OAuth broker** — it performs the provider dance and delivers
   the session via the HttpOnly refresh cookie, so the frontend never sees the
   authorization code or `state`. `/callback` only triggers a silent refresh.
   The CSRF protection for the OAuth flow is the backend's; there is nothing for
   the frontend to validate. (Confirm this contract holds if the flow changes.)
3. **`config.js` runtime config injection.** `<script src="/config.js">` loads
   the API base URL written by the deploy. It is same-origin (covered by
   `script-src 'self'`), served over HTTPS with immutable caching. The residual
   risk is a deploy-pipeline / host compromise — infrastructure trust, outside
   the frontend code's control.

   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) is deliberately not added in app code here.**
   `config.js` is generated at deploy time by the Docker entrypoint, so its hash
   is unknown at build — SRI on it belongs to that entrypoint: compute
   `sha384` of the generated file and inject `integrity="sha384-…"` into the
   `index.html` script tag it writes (the same step that writes `config.js`).
   For the in-repo static scripts (`theme-init.js`), build-time SRI was
   evaluated and **declined**: they are same-origin and already constrained by
   `script-src 'self'`, while `integrity` would break the app if any host-side
   byte transform (minify, re-encode) touched them — net-negative for a
   negligible gain. Revisit if these scripts ever move to a third-party origin.

4. **Login is not synced across tabs** (only logout is). A fresh tab obtains its
   own token via the boot silent-refresh; tokens never leave their tab's memory.
   Propagating login would tempt cross-tab token sharing for no security gain.
5. **Client-side RBAC is non-authoritative.** Route guards (`requirePermission`,
   the security gateway) and UI gating (`useCan`, `<Gate>`) read the in-memory
   role + active-org permission set — including `super_admin` god-mode in
   [`core/rbac/policies.ts`](../../src/core/rbac/policies.ts) (`role === 'super_admin' → true`).
   A tampered in-memory store can flip any of these **client-side**. This is
   accepted: it is UX/redirect logic only — **every** org-scoped action re-checks
   on the backend (via the signed `org` claim in the access token), and the route loader's fetch is the
   real authorization boundary (API 403/404 → Unauthorized/NotFound islands).
   Never let a destructive action rely on the client check alone.

## Backend's half (confirm, don't implement here)

- The refresh cookie must be `SameSite=Lax` (or stricter) and the backend must
  reject auth requests missing `X-Requested-With` — together with the frontend's
  custom header, that closes CSRF on `/auth/refresh`.
- Rate-limiting / brute-force protection on `/auth/login` (the frontend adds a
  client-side cooldown for UX, not as the control).
- Per-request authorization: every frontend guard is UX; the backend re-checks
  membership, status, and permission on every org-scoped endpoint.
